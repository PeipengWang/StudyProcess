**Title:** A Deep Clustering Framework for Hyperspectral Images Based on Data Augmentation and Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning

**Abstract:** Hyperspectral image (HSI) clustering remains a challenging task due to limited labeled data and the complexity of high-dimensional spectral information. To address these issues, we propose a two-stage deep clustering framework combining data augmentation and self-supervised contrastive learning. First, we enhance both spatial and spectral features via carefully designed augmentation strategies to expand data diversity without damaging intrinsic relationships. Then, we integrate a dual-network contrastive learning module to jointly optimize feature representation and clustering assignments in an online manner. Experimental results on three benchmark HSI datasets (Indian Pines, Salinas, Houston) demonstrate significant improvements in clustering accuracy, robustness, and generalization over existing methods.

**1. Introduction** Hyperspectral imaging provides detailed spectral information per pixel, making it valuable for fine-grained analysis tasks such as land cover classification and target detection. However, the absence of labeled data and the high dimensionality of HSI data pose significant challenges. Clustering, as an unsupervised learning technique, has the potential to extract meaningful patterns from large-scale HSIs. Recent advances in deep learning, particularly self-supervised learning (SSL) and contrastive frameworks, offer new tools to tackle these challenges. This paper proposes a novel deep clustering pipeline for HSIs that leverages data augmentation and contrastive learning.

**2. Related Work** Early HSI clustering methods include k-means and FCM, which suffer from poor scalability and shallow representations. Recent methods employ autoencoders, subspace learning, and deep embedding clustering (e.g., DEC, DCN). Self-supervised learning frameworks such as SimCLR and MoCo have shown promise in computer vision, while their application to HSI clustering remains underexplored. Additionally, HSI-specific data augmentation, leveraging spectral-spatial characteristics, is critical but underutilized.

**3. Methodology** Our framework consists of two modules:

**3.1 Data Augmentation Module:** We perform joint spectral-spatial augmentations to generate multiple views per sample. Techniques include spatial flipping, spectral shifting, and random cropping. These augmentations preserve semantic consistency while improving data diversity.

**3.2 Contrastive Clustering Module:** A dual-branch network encodes two augmented views of the same input. We apply a projection head and compute the InfoNCE loss to align representations of positive pairs and repel negatives. Clustering assignments are optimized using a KL-divergence-based auxiliary target distribution, enabling end-to-end joint representation and clustering learning.

**4. Experiments**

**4.1 Datasets:** We evaluate on three public datasets:

- Indian Pines (200 bands, 16 classes)
- Salinas (204 bands, 16 classes)
- Houston (144 bands, 15 classes)

**4.2 Metrics:** We report OA (Overall Accuracy), NMI, ARI, and Purity.

**4.3 Results:** Our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines including DEC, MoCo, and recent deep clustering models. Ablation studies verify the importance of both augmentation and contrastive modules. Visualizations (t-SNE, cluster maps) confirm improved class separation.

**5. Conclusion** We propose a novel HSI clustering framework that combines data augmentation and self-supervised contrastive learning. It addresses key limitations in existing methods, achieving better clustering performance and generalization. Future work includes extending to multi-modal fusion and real-time onboard applications.
